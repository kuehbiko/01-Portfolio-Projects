### [‚ôªÔ∏è Visualizing 2003-2022 Waste Generation and Recycling Trends in Singapore](https://github.com/kuehbiko/01-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Waste%20and%20Recycling%20Trends%20in%20Singapore)
**Topics:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Storytelling
**Tools:** Python (pandas, nltk), PostgreSQL, Tableau
**Description:** Explored and visualized 20 years of Singapore's waste and recycling data from the NEA website to understand the trends in the waste generation and overall recycling rates over the years. Applied statistical linear regression to predict future recycling trends in Singapore, an understand if our goal of an overall recycling rate of 70% by 2023 is still achievable. We found:
- Singapore's recycling rate has been constantly increasing since 2003. However since 2018, restrictions on waste exports, increase in freight transportation costs and covid-19 have dealt us significant blows.
- According to data from 2020 to 2022, our overall recycling rate has recovered slightly, increasing by 5% in 2021 and 2% in 2022. However, this is likely due to the uptick of activities in the wake of the country recovering from covid-19 restrictions. 
- For specific materials, plastic recycling rates have been declining since 2007, and is the material with one of the lowest recycling rates, second only to textile and leather.

### [üíº Salifort Motors HR Predictive Analysis with Binary Classification](https://github.com/kuehbiko/01-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Salifort%20Motors%20HR%20Predictive%20Analysis)
**Topics:** Data Analysis, Predictive Analysis, HR Analysis, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Binary Classification \
**Tools:** Python (pandas, scipy, sci-kit learn, seaborn, matplotlib) \
**Description:** Explored and analyzed employee data to determine the key variables that cause employees to leave the company and predicted the employees most at risk of leaving. 
- Constructed and compared two binary classification models (a logistic regression and decision tree model) with cross-validation to achieve the most accurate result.
- The decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 98%, which outperformed the accuracy of the logistic regression model (82%).
- The most significant factors that lead to an employee leaving by descending order or gini importance are: satisfaction, last evaluation score and number of projects worked on.

### [üö≤ Lyft Baywheels 2022 Analysis](https://github.com/kuehbiko/01-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Lyft%20Baywheels%202022%20Analysis)
**Topics:** Data Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization \
**Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, plotly) \
**Description:** Analyzed and wrangled over 2 million rows of Lyft Baywheels trip data from 2022 to understand how the company can better cater to the needs of different groups of customers. From extensive analysis, determined that:
- Subscribers are more likely to use the bikes as reliable transportation to work during peak hours, while non-subscribers prefer to use bikes for leisure during offpeak hours and on weekends. Subscribers prefer classic bikes by a small margin, while non-subscribers strongly prefer electric bikes. Thus provide fast classic bikes for subscribers, and comfortable electric bikes for non-subscribers.
- Electric bikes are utilized for longer distances, accruing greater mileage in a shorter period of time and thus may be more prone to wear and tear. The company may wish to check on the condition of these bikes more often
- Page St at Masonic Ave and Leavenworth St at Broadway stations have the greatest deficit in bikes at the end of the day. More docks can be placed at these stations, and more bikes can be allocated to these stations during rebalancing overnight. 

### [üéÆ Video Game Sales Exploratory Analysis and Hypothesis Testing](https://github.com/kuehbiko/01-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Video%20Game%20Sales%20Exploratory%20Analysis)
**Topics:** Data Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing \
**Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) \
**Description:** Analyzed historical video game sales data from 1980 to 2016 to understand what kinds of video games are popular in the current market and how video game retailers can use this to increase revenue. 
- Wrangled data with over 8000 missing and duplicate values. Fixed data errors, filled in missing values using secondary sources.
- Visualized trends of consumer preferences of genre, platform and publisher. Constructed a profile of consumers per region, noting significant difference between Western and Japanese consumer preferences.
- Through hypothesis testing, found that the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same, while the average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different.
- Finally, provided recommendations on potentially popular platforms, genres for video game sales to boost revenue for video game retailers.
