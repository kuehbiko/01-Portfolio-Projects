### Salifort Motors HR Predictive Analysis
**Topics:** Data Analysis, Predictive Analysis, HR Analysis, Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree \
**Tools:** Python (pandas, scipy, sci-kit learn, seaborn, matplotlib) \
**Description:** Explored and analyzed employee data to determine the key variables that cause employees to leave the company and predicted the employees most at risk of leaving. Constructed and compared two binary classification models (a logistic regression and decision tree model) with cross-validation to achieve the most accurate result. The decision tree model achieved an accuracy of 98%, which outperformed the accuracy of the logistic regression model (82%). The most significant factors that lead to an employee leaving by descending order or gini importance are: satisfaction, last evaluation score and number of projects worked on.


### [Video Game Sales Analysis](https://github.com/kuehbiko/01-Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Video%20Game%20Sales%20Exploratory%20Analysis)
**Topics:** Data Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Hypothesis Testing \
**Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) \
**Description:** Analyzed historical video game sales data from 1980 to 2016 to understand what kinds of video games are popular in the current market and how video game retailers can use this to increase revenue. Wrangled data with over 8000 missing and duplicate values. Fixed data errors, filled in missing values using secondary sources. Visualized trends of consumer preferences of genre, platform and publisher. Constructed a profile of consumers per region, noting significant difference between Western and Japanese consumer preferences. Through hypothesis testing, found that the average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same, while the average user ratings for Action and Sports genres are different. Finally, provided recommendations on potentially popular platforms, genres for video game sales to boost revenue for video game retailers.
